# Blobgram

A product demo of client side routing, including nested routing, deep linking, bottom navigation, and multiple navigators. 

# Notes 

* Instead of using Flutter's declarative navigator, I used an open source navigation package of it was way, way easier to do so. 

* I chose AutoRoute over GetX because of its powerful and simple nested routing features.
