# Blobgram

A product demo of client side routing, made with blobs. Features include deep linking, nested routing, and bottom navigation. 

# Notes 

* I opted for a navigation package instead of mastering the Flutter's declarative framework because it was way easier. 

* I chose AutoRoute over GetX because, with the latter, I couldn't figure out how to implement multiple navigation stacks and keep them in memory.
